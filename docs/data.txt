House Plan
Orchard Park High School is organized
into three smaller units called “houses.”
Each house is composed of students
in grades 9 through 12 randomly
selected. Students within each house
are assigned to a core of homerooms
based on their cohort. Each
homeroom is assigned to one of two
school counselors located in the
house office.
Homerooms are scheduled to remain
intact through the student's high
school career and to be affiliated with
the same house principal, school
counselor, homeroom teacher, and
house secretaries.
Another vital aspect of the house
organization at Orchard Park is the
assignment of subject areas and
faculty to houses. House I contains the
following departments: art, business,
health, music, physical education, and
special education. House II consists of
earth science, math, media, and social
studies. English, biology, chemistry,
languages, technology education, and
physics are found in House III.
The goal of the assignment of subject
areas to different houses is to provide
for the most efficient utilization of
facilities including materials, planning
areas, and for the adoption of various
teaching strategies. In addition, the
house principal provides the
leadership for communication of
departmental concerns such as
budget, scheduling, and curriculum
planning.
In a large school such as Orchard Park
High School, student and faculty
identification is easier to achieve with
an organizational scheme such as the
house plan. Our house plan high
school truly provides the program
advantages of a large school, yet
maintains the closeness of a smaller
school.
Grade Reporting
Report Cards
Student grades will be issued
following the 10th, 20th, 30th, and 40th
Published using Google Docs Report abuse weeks of school. These reports will be
available on the parent portal. Report
cards are a summary of achievements.
OPHS 2025-2026 Curriculum Handbook Subject achievement is denoted by a
numerical grade with 65 being the
minimum passing grade.
Individualized teacher comments may
be denoted on the report card.
Parents are invited to confer with the
school personnel at any time.

Updated automatically every 5
minutes
Interim Reports
Interim reports will be available
through the parent portal following the
5th, 15th, 25th, and 35th weeks of
school. If a student is underachieving
or in danger of failing a course, parents
should expect timely communication
from the teacher either through an
interim report or other means such as
a telephone call or message conveyed
through the student. These reports
may help to make the parents aware
of a problem or a potential problem or
may serve to report exceptional
progress. Students should discuss
progress reports with parents, school
counselors, and teachers.
Honor Roll and Merit Roll
Students must meet the following
requirements in order to be on the
High School honor roll or merit roll:
Honor Roll - 90% or higher cumulative
average in all subject studies
(Exception: labs).
Merit Roll - 85% or higher cumulative
average in all subject studies
(Exception: labs).
Four or more numerically graded
courses are required for honor roll or
merit roll consideration.
Honor roll and merit roll lists are
published after the 10th, 20th, and
30th weeks. No honor roll and merit
roll lists are published for the 40th

NCAA Freshman
Eligibility Standards
Student athletes wishing to play sports
in college at the Division I or II levels
must register with the NCAA Eligibility
Center at the end of their junior year.
At that point, students should see
their counselor to have a transcript
sent to the NCAA. Information
regarding NCAA eligibility can be
found at www.eligibilitycenter.org.
Contact the NCAA at (877) 262-1492.
Academic Standards
The NCAA Eligibility Center verifies the
academic and amateur status of all
student-athletes who wish to compete
in Division I or II athletics. Please work
with your prospective colleges and the
NCAA Eligibility Center to make sure
that all of the academic eligibility
standards will be met.
College-bound student-athletes who
want to practice, compete, and receive
athletically related financial aid during
their first year at a Division I or II school
need to meet the following
requirements:
● Graduate from high school.
● Complete a minimum of 16
core courses for Division I or 16
core courses for Division II.
● Earn a minimum required
grade-point average in core
courses.
● Earn a qualifying test score on
either the ACT or SAT.
● Request final amateurism
certification from the NCAA
Eligibility Center.
Academic Requirements for Division I
and Division II athletics are updated by
the NCAA frequently. For the most up-
to-date information and minimum
academic standards, please visit
www.eligibilitycenter.org.
● When you register for the SAT
or ACT, use the NCAA
Eligibility Center code of 9999
to ensure all SAT and ACT
scores are reported directly to
the NCAA Eligibility Center
from the testing agency. Test
scores do not appear on
transcripts.
● The Division I core GPA
requirement is a minimum of
Published using Google Docs Report abuse 2.30.
● The Division II core GPA

Division III.
Rank in Class
The student with the highest average
in each grade is ranked “one” for that
grade. The student with the second
highest average is ranked "two," etc. A
student’s average is calculated by
using all courses taken in high school.
Courses with letter grades (i.e.
Freshman Boost) are excluded from
ranking consideration. Honors and
Advanced Placement course grades
receive 1.05 times the value of other
courses in determining rank. A six
semester rank (determined at the end
of junior year) and a seven semester
rank (determined midway through the
senior year) are calculated.
To be officially ranked, students need
to complete 3 consecutive semesters
of study at OPHS prior to the 7th
semester ranking. Students will not be
eligible for the Orchard Park High
School senior honors which depend
on rank in class (i.e. Valedictorian,
Salutatorian, Top Ten, etc.) without this
requirement. They will be assigned an
"honorary rank" within the school.
However, an "official" transcript rank
will be assigned based on the
student's total grades for purposes of
colleges, post-high school training,
military, etc.
Any exceptions to this procedure must
be approved by the high school
principal. Questions about rank should
be discussed with your school
counselor.
Alternatives to Regents
Examinations
Scores obtained on appropriate
examinations of the College Board and
the American College Testing
Programs, as designated by the
Commissioner, may be used in lieu of
the corresponding Regents
Examination requirements for a
Regents or Advanced Regents
Diploma. Please see your school
counselor for further information.

Local
Local examinations are given for
courses that have been developed by
Orchard Park High School teachers.
Department examinations are local
examinations that are designed by a
team of teachers to test all students
enrolled in a course.
Regents
Regents examinations are end-of-
course examinations based on state
courses of study. Beginning within the
2022-23 school year, Regents exams
are not factored into the student’s final
course grade.
Regents Examination Retakes
Students are permitted to retake
Regents exams in an effort to improve
their exam score. Since Regents
examinations must be ordered in
advance, it will be necessary to see
your school counselor to determine
eligibility and register to retake a
Regents examination. Any student who
was absent for a Regents Examination
due to illness or other special
circumstances must follow the same
procedure listed above for Regents
retakes. Approval from the House
Principal is necessary for any unusual
situation that may arise.
All other situations involving the taking
of Regents examinations are special
and will require specific written
approval from the high school
principal. Special cases include:
students with specialized talent,
students from other high schools, a
student who meets the time
requirements but is not enrolled in an
"R" course, etc. The general practice
will be to determine the intent and
capability of the student through
discussion with the school counselor.
Written approval may be given by the
high school principal on an individual
basis.
Advanced Placement
Advanced Placement examinations are
given in courses following the outline
of the College Board. Although these
students are highly encouraged to
take the exams, they are not
mandatory. The examinations have
been developed to test at the college
level of performance. Students who
do well on these examinations
frequently get college credit for the
subject being tested based on the
academic credit policies of individual
post-secondary institutions.

student must have the potential to
graduate no later than August
immediately following the anticipated
June graduation date. To qualify for

and only with the house principal’s
recommendation and the high school
principal’s approval.
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory
Grades
A satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S or U)
grade may be given as follows: a
student may request written
permission from their teacher to take a
course on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory
basis. The credit will count toward
graduation, but no grade other than "S"
or "U" will be entered on the
permanent grade record. The course
will not affect rank in the class. A
student may take two satisfactory/
unsatisfactory courses per school year
(1 credit total) provided each course is
credited in the elective area toward
graduation requirements. Each
student must work out the
requirements for obtaining a
SATISFACTORY grade with their
teacher. Permission forms are
available from school counselors in

required paperwork. Normally a
course will be repeated in its entirety.
Refer to specific departmental
guidelines. The current subject
teacher will be required to notify the
counselor and the registrar of any
change necessary in a student's
record as a result of passing a repeat
course at any time other than June.
Summer School
Students permitted to attend summer
school will have a portion of their June
final grade incorporated into the
computation of their summer school
final average. Ten percent of the
summer school final average will be
based on the student's course average
earned in June.
Required Minimum Schedule
Each student must have a minimum of
five (5) courses plus physical education
each semester. any exception to this
rule must be approved by the house
principal.
Schedule Changes
Student schedule changes are set up
by counselors to take into account the
future plans of the student, parental
requests and teacher
recommendations. Because
schedules are developed to give the
student the best program possible,
changes of schedule are considered a
serious matter. Under no
circumstances may a student simply
stop attending a class or study period.
If a student, parents, the teachers and
the school counselor agree that a
schedule change is needed, a teacher,
student, parent and school counselor
signature on an official drop form for
the change requested is necessary.
Until the change is arranged and the
student receives a copy of the new
schedule from the school counselor,
the student must attend classes on
their original schedule. A level change
requires written agreement among the
teachers, student, parent, and school
counselor. Any disagreement requires
a conference of the parties involved
and a final decision by the house
principal.
Schedule Change Dates
Published using Google Docs Report abuse Any student seeking a schedule
change should see their counselor for
a form as soon as possible. Signatures

student day of the second quarter for
a first semester course, the end of the
first student day of the fourth quarter
for a second semester course and the
end of the first student day of the third
quarter for a full year course. A course
dropped after these dates will be
designated as a Drop/Fail. A course
may not be dropped unless a student
maintains a five-course schedule in
addition to Physical Education. Any
exception to this procedure must be
approved by the house principal.
Independent Study
Independent Study credit may be
granted for approved courses of study
in the curriculum. A student who uses

courses plus P.E. for a required
minimum schedule must be assigned
daily to a supervised area. Credit will

Early Graduation
Graduation prior to completion of four
years of high school study may be
approved on an individual basis. A
student considering early graduation
should discuss individual high school
needs and future plans with his/her
parents and school counselor. A
required form for early graduation is
available from the student’s school
counselor. This form calls for a
rationale for requesting early
graduation, the number of credits
earned to date and the course names
and credits needed for graduation.
Upon initial submission of this form,
the student can anticipate a meeting
with his/her House Principal to discuss
individual situations. This form must
be signed by the student’s parent(s),
school counselor, house principal and
finally by the high school principal.
Forms should be completed during
the spring of the junior year. The high
school principal will review such
requests by the end of scheduling
week in the fall. A student’s schedule
will not be changed to reflect early
graduation status until final approval
has been received from the high
school principal. Any exceptions to
this procedure must be approved by
the high school principal.
Cancellation of a Course or
Program:
An elective course may be canceled
due to insufficient student requests for
enrollment. Courses of study or entire
elective programs may also be
canceled if fiscal conditions warrant at
any time.
